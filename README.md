### Motivation/Why did you build this project?

This project was built as part of the odin projects front end fundamentals course. This specific project was used to introduce new corders to HTML and CSS aspects with a focus on Flex Box.

### What problems did you solve?

Having completed a similar project from freecodecamp.org I used this opportunity to improve that design too make it more modern/appealing. This included using an mp4 loop to create a moving background that quickly catches the eye as well as using a color palette that is more appealing to the eye. I used box shadowing and text decorations to ensure that some key features stick out and immediately that the attention of the viewers.

This project helped me to fully understand a lot of CSS principles that I previously didn't fully grasp. It also taught me the importance of using google developers inspect tool as an aid to correct and refine some of the styling of this project and others to come. 

### What makes your project stand out?

I believe that the moving mp4 background makes this project stand out against similar projects. I also believe that the general layout and highlighting features help key aspects of the landing page really 'pop' and catch the eye of the viewer.
